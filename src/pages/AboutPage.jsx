            <p><strong>Emskincare</strong> is a Scandinavian/English speaking skincare salon located in Antibes, and my vision is to make everyone feel welcome and to be able to enjoy a relaxing treatment. In addition, I will be able to help and guide you with your questions and needs, walk you through your skincare routine and help you to choose products suited for your personal needs.</p>
            <p>Skincare is a science and being well informed and having a basic understanding leads to results that will last long after you leave the salon.</p>

              <h1>Our Story</h1>
              <p>My name is Emelie and I grew up in Malm√∂, Sweden. I started working on super yachts as a stewardess in 2011, before following my dreams to take my degree as a Cidesco certified esthetician in 2018. In recent years I have worked at both spa facilities and salons.</p>

              <p>I moved to France in 2021 and decided to open EmSkincare at Rue du marc in Antibes. I look forward to taking care of you.</p>
