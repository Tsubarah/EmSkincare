          <h1>Our Story</h1>
          <p>My name is Emelie and I grew up in Malm√∂, Sweden. I started working on super yachts as a stewardess in 2011, before following my dreams to take my degree as a Cidesco certified esthetician in 2018. In recent years I have worked at both spa facilities and salons.</p>

          <p>I moved to France in 2021 and decided to open EmSkincare at Rue du marc in Antibes. I look forward to taking care of you.</p>
